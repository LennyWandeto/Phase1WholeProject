#### Date, 2024/04/12

#### By *Lenny Wachira Wandeto*

## Description
This is a whole project combinimg JavaScript, HTML and CSS to make an excellent single-page web application. The main aim
of this project is to make an application where a user can easily buy, remove, filter and search for art from various famous artists.
It is supposed to emulate what an artist wants in an application through visual appeal, but add functionality as well to perform.

## Files Within:

### index.html
This HTML file is just used to give a backbone to the web application for appearance and functionality. It is where all DOM elements from
the JavaScript file will be appended to.

### style.css
CSS is meant purely for styling and certain pseudo-functions such as hovering to change color of certain elements.

### index.js

JavaScript in this project does a lot of things. It has multiple functions from fetching from an API, mainly the GET, PATCH and DELETE methods. These are the main buttons that update the JSON file. It also has alot of event listeners, with the following events: DOMContentLoaded, change and input. This is what I use in the filter buttons and the search bar, so that it has immediate functionality when you switch between filters, or it updates immediately the moment you tyoe a letter. The JS file is what updates the DOM as well to show each card effectively.

### db.json

This JSON file is meant for storing data about artwork. It is affected by fetch requests from index.js
